# Repository Guidelines

Codex agents use a single source of truth for contributor instructions. Review `REPOSITORY_GUIDELINES.md` in this directory (or [open it here](./REPOSITORY_GUIDELINES.md)) before making changes to ensure expectations on structure, tooling, and review flow stay aligned.

Keep this file untouched beyond referencing the central guide so both human and AI contributors stay in sync.
