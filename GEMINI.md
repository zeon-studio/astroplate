# Repository Guidelines

Gemini agents share contributor instructions via `REPOSITORY_GUIDELINES.md`. Please read [the central guide](./REPOSITORY_GUIDELINES.md) for project structure, workflow, and review requirements before acting on any task.

Do not duplicate guidance here; update the central file if expectations change so both assistants stay consistent.
